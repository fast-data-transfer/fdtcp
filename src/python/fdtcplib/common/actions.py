Classes holding details of communication transmitted between fdtcp and fdtd.

Implementations of actions - factual starting of FDT Java client/server
    processes by fdtd

Actions classes represent actions initiated from fdtcp, then shipped to
    remote party fdtd where some action instance settings are finalized
    and eventually performed.

Actions .execute() methods are called on the side of fdtd, so caller
    as well as the conf object are the one associated with the fdtd
    remote party and not with local fdtcp.
